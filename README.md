pocores
=======

`pocores` is a rule-based coreference resolution system for German using the
*filters and preferences* approach (Lappin and Leass 1994; Stuckardt 2001).
It requires dependency parsed input sentences in CoNLL 2009/2010 format, which can i.a. be produced by [mate-tools](http://code.google.com/p/mate-tools/) (Bohnet 2010).

The code was originally written by Tobias G체nther for his Bachelor's thesis (G체nther 2011),
but has been heavily refactored and is now based on the
[discoursegraphs](https://github.com/arne-cl/discoursegraphs) library (Neumann, to appear).
